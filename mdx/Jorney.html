          <h2>Beginning</h2>
          <p>Our jorney began on March 1, 2021 with the purchase of a domain (extaas.com) on which we installed Wordpress. The main purpose of using the domain was to get to know the Wordpress environment and learn web development. In addition to web development, we tried ways to earn money on the page, which was first e-commerce and later affiliate marketing.</p>
          <h3>Own code</h3>
          <p>On July 6, 2022, we published a subdomain (app.extaas.com) where we wrote a website from scratch using the Svelte framework and movie database API to display popular movies. <a href="https://extaas.netlify.app/">Visit the page.</a></p>
          <h3>Free solutions</h3>
          <p>On February 8, 2023, we canceled the hosting order for the domain (extaas.com) and started using free solutions completely.</p>
